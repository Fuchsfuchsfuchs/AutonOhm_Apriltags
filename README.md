# AutonOhm_Apriltags
The Apriltags used in the TH NÃ¼rnberg AutonOhm Team, which participates in the Robocup @work and rescue leagues. Following the [Rulebook](https://github.com/robocup-at-work/rulebook/blob/main/Rulebook.pdf "The Holy Scripture") the generated Apriltags are part of the 36h11 family which consists of 2221 IDs. In the @work league are currently 16 IDs in use, so maybe there could be a chance to use the 36h15 family in the future which only consists of 27 individual IDs but offers a significantly reduced false positive rate. Version 1 uses the "inflammable_age" font which is in the public domain and pretty close to being a monospace font.
